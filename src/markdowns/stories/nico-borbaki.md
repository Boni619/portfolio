# Nefarious Nico Borbaki
#### May 5, 2018

Nico Borbaki looked at the enchanted newspaper in his hands and felt conflicted.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his steam-punk surroundings. He had always hated futuristic Alpha Centauri IX with its blue, bright buildings. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel conflicted.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Encino Slartibarfast. Encino was a clever giant with ginger fingers and sticky legs.

Nico gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a tight-fisted, malicious, whiskey drinker with pink fingers and pointy legs. His friends saw him as a victorious, vigilant vicar. Once, he had even saved a spotless kitten that was stuck in a drain.

But not even a tight-fisted person who had once saved a spotless kitten that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what Encino had in store today.

The drizzle rained like skipping horses, making Nico stressed.

As Nico stepped outside and Encino came closer, he could see the talented smile on his face.

"I am here because I want revenge," Encino bellowed, in an articulate tone. He slammed his fist against Nico's chest, with the force of 2094 rats. "I frigging hate you, Nico Borbaki."

Nico looked back, even more stressed and still fingering the enchanted newspaper. "Encino, bastard," he replied.

They looked at each other with hatred feelings, like two motionless, mighty mice shouting at a very ruthless accident, which had classical music playing in the background and two sinister uncles drinking to the beat.

Nico regarded Encino's ginger fingers and sticky legs. He held out his hand. "Let's not fight," he whispered, gently.

"Hmph," pondered Encino.

"Please?" begged Nico with puppy dog eyes.

Encino looked fuzzy, his body blushing like a bewildered, bad banana.

Then Encino came inside for a nice glass of whiskey.
