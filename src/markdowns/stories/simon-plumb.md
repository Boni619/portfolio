# Simon Plumb and the Two Kind Gerbils
#### September 20, 2018

Once upon a time there was a virtuous boy called Simon Plumb. He was on the way to see his Annie Superhalk, when he decided to take a short cut through Thetford Forest.

It wasn't long before Simon got lost. He looked around, but all he could see were trees. Nervously, he felt into his bag for his favourite toy, Laura, but Laura was nowhere to be found! Simon began to panic. He felt sure he had packed Laura. To make matters worse, he was starting to feel hungry.

Unexpectedly, he saw a kind gerbil dressed in a pink pinafore disappearing into the trees.

"How odd!" thought Simon.

For the want of anything better to do, he decided to follow the peculiarly dressed gerbil. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.

Eventually, Simon reached a clearing. In the clearing were three houses, one made from pumpkins, one made from pancakes and one made from fruit gums.

Simon could feel his tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease his hunger.

"Hello!" he called. "Is anybody there?"

Nobody replied.

Simon looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.

A cackle broke through the air, giving Simon a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Laura!

"Laura!" shouted Simon. He turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"

The witch just shrugged.

"Give Laura back!" cried Simon.

"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.

"At least let Laura out of that cage!"

Before she could reply, two kind gerbils rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Simon recognised the one in the pink pinafore that he'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.

"Hello Big Gerbil," said the witch.

"Good morning." The gerbil noticed Laura. "Who is this?"

"That's Laura," explained the witch.

"Ooh! Laura would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the gerbil.

The witch shook her head. "Laura is staying with me."

"Um... Excuse me..." Simon interrupted. "Laura lives with me! And not in a cage!"

Big Gerbil ignored him. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.

The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."

Big Gerbil looked at the house made from fruit gums and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from fruit gums if I wanted to."

"That's nothing," said the next gerbil. "I could eat two houses."

"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Laura."

Simon watched, feeling very worried. He didn't want the witch to give Laura to Big Gerbil. He didn't think Laura would like living with a kind gerbil, away from his house and all his other toys.

The other one gerbils watched while Big Gerbil put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.

"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Gerbil. "Just you watch!"

Big Gerbil pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from pancakes. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.

   And more.

      And more.

Eventually, Big Gerbil started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of pancakes, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.

"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Gerbil.

Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!

"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.

Big Gerbil never finished eating the front door made from pancakes and Laura remained trapped in the witch's cage.

Average Gerbil stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Gerbil. "Just you watch!"

Average Gerbil pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.

   And more.

      And more.

After a while, Average Gerbil started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...

   ...and greener.

A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.

"I'm not a bush, I'm a gerbil!" said Average Gerbil.

"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."

"No! Wait!" cried Average Gerbil, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the gerbil away under his arm.

Average Gerbil never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Laura remained trapped in the witch's cage.

"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Laura."

"Not so fast," said Simon. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from pumpkins. And I haven't had a turn yet.

"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."

The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give him a chance. It's only fair."

"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the gerbils. He won't last long."

"I'll be right back," said Simon.

"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Laura back."

Simon ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. He came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, he broke off a piece of the door of the house made from pumpkins and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, he took a bite. He quickly devoured the whole piece.

Simon sat down on a nearby log.

"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."

"I haven't finished," explained Simon. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."

When Simon's food had digested, he broke off another piece of the door made from pumpkins. Once more, he toasted his food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. He ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.

Eventually, after several sittings, Simon was down to the final piece of the door made from pumpkins. Carefully, he toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. He finished his final course. Simon had eaten the entire front door of the house made from pumpkins.

The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"

"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little boy won fair and square. Now hand over Laura or I will chop your broomstick in half."

The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.

Simon hurried over and grabbed Laura, checking that his favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Laura was unharmed.

Simon thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Annie. It was starting to get dark.

When Simon got to Annie's house, his threw her arms around him.

"I was so worried!" cried Annie. "You are very late."

As Simon described his day, he could tell that Annie didn't believe him. So he grabbed a napkin from his pocket.

"What's that?" asked Annie.

Simon unwrapped a doorknob made from pancakes. "Pudding!" he said.

Annie almost fell off her chair.
