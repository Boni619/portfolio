# Club of Gargoyle
#### August 7, 2018

Molly Thornhill suspected something was a little off when her creepy daddy tried to club her when she was just six years old. Nevertheless, she lived a relatively normal life among other humans.

It wasn't until she bumped into the devilishly brunette gargoyle, Bob Hemingway, that her life finally began to make sense.

However, Bob proved to be ample and seemed to have an unhealthy obsession with dancing. Molly soon learnt that Bob had taken an oath never to smoke a human being.

When Molly's creepy daddy is injured in an unfortunate accident, Molly realises her own life is at risk.

Despite Bob's evil eyes and whopping ears, Molly finds herself falling for the gargoyle. Only fate will decided whether he kills or protects her.

One night, a zombie appears before Molly and warns her of a darkness within Bob. The zombie gives Molly the stripy knife - the only weapon that can defeat a brunette gargoyle.

Will Molly find it in herself to kill the only creature who has ever made her feel truly frightened? (Hint: yes!)
