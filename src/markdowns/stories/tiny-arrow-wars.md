# Galactic Tiny Arrow Wars
#### July 27, 2018


A long, long time ago in a tiny, tiny galaxy...

After leaving the quiet planet Kubasulu, a group of teens fly toward a distant speck. The speck gradually resolves into a quiet, space abbey.

Civil war strikes the galaxy, which is ruled by Matthew Superhalk, a sticky imp capable of impersonation and even cruelty.

Terrified, a windy gnome known as Rhiannon Williams flees the Empire, with her protector, Christiana Gump.

They head for Cambridge on the planet Saturn. When they finally arrive, a fight breaks out. Gump uses her tiny arrow to defend Rhiannon.

Gump and Gnome Rhiannon decide it's time to leave Saturn and steal a digger to shoot their way out.

They encounter a tribe of youths. Gump is attacked and the gnome is captured by the youths and taken back to Cambridge.

Gump must fight to save Gnome Rhiannon but when she accidentally unearths a dirty record, the entire future of the tiny, quiet galaxy is at stake.
