# Jack Butterscotch | The Dragon
#### June 10, 2018

In a hole there lived a tender, silver dragon named Jack Butterscotch. Not an enchanted red, stripy hole, filled with flamingos and a cold smell, nor yet a short, hairy, skinny hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a dragon-hole, and that means happiness.

One day, after a troubling visit from the imp Clarke Blast, Jack leaves his hole and sets out in search of three happy charms. A quest undertaken in the company of ogres, wizards and sensational teens.

In the search for the imp-guarded charms, Jack Butterscotch surprises even himself with his resourcefulness and skill as a scout.

During his travels, Jack rescues a book, an heirloom belonging to Clarke. But when Clarke refuses to try sleeping, their friendship is over.

However, Clarke is wounded at the Battle of Blenheim and the two reconcile just before Jack engages in some serious sleeping.

Jack accepts one of the three happy charms and returns home to his hole a very wealthy dragon.
