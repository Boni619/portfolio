He had always hated futuristic Alpha Centauri IX with its blue, bright buildings. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel conflicted.</p><p>Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Encino Slartibarfast. Encino was a clever giant with ginger fingers and sticky legs.</p><p>Nico gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a tight-fisted, malicious, whiskey drinker with pink fingers and pointy legs. His friends saw him as a victorious, vigilant vicar. Once, he had even saved a spotless kitten that was stuck in a drain.</p><p>But not even a tight-fisted person who had once saved a spotless kitten that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what Encino had in store today.</p><p>The drizzle rained like skipping horses, making Nico stressed.</p><p>As Nico stepped outside and Encino came closer, he could see the talented smile on his face.</p><p>“I am here because I want revenge,” Encino bellowed, in an articulate tone. He slammed his fist against Nico’s chest, with the force of 2094 rats. “I frigging hate you, Nico Borbaki.”</p><p>Nico looked back, even more stressed and still fingering the enchanted newspaper. “Encino, bastard,” he replied.</p><p>They looked at each other with hatred feelings, like two motionless, mighty mice shouting at a very ruthless accident, which had classical music playing in the background and two sinister uncles drinking to the beat.</p><p>Nico regarded Encino’s ginger fingers and sticky legs. He held out his hand. “Let’s not fight,” he whispered, gently.</p><p>“Hmph,” pondered Encino.</p><p>“Please?” begged Nico with puppy dog eyes.</p><p>Encino looked fuzzy, his body blushing like a bewildered, bad banana.</p><p>Then Encino came inside for a nice glass of whiskey.</p>",17),o=[s],l={__name:"nico-borbaki",setup(r,{expose:e}){return e({frontmatter:{}}),(d,h)=>(i(),t("div",a,o))}};export{l as default};
